# Day-Number-Calculator
The Day Number Calculator is a simple C++ program that allows users to input a month number and date, and then calculates and outputs the day number of the target day within the year.

**Features:**

Input: The program prompts the user to enter the month number and date, representing the target day.

Calculation: Based on the provided month and date, the calculator calculates the day number of the target day by adding the total days of the previous months to the given date.

Output: The program displays the calculated day number as the result.

**How to Use:**

Run the program.
Enter the month number when prompted by the console.
Enter the date number within the specified month.
The program will then process the input and display the day number of the target day.

**Note:**

The Day Number Calculator assumes the user will input valid month numbers (1 to 12) and corresponding dates.
The calculator does not account for leap years or handle invalid dates (e.g., February 30).
